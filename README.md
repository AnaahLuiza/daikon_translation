# Overview

Daikon is a turn-based **RPG Discord bot**, created in 2020, and is currently in its *third* re-creation.
Containing a fun and diverse battle system!

Right now, Daikon is not complete, but we are progressing more every day to finish it and we have fun with a great bot!

# Translation
This is a project with the sole purpose of optimize and fully translate and categorize the bot and its texts such as items, lore and much more.
Making it capable of also translating the bot in the future in a simple way and with the help of other people!
